# Portfolio

This is my portfolio which contains some of the projects I've worked on.

## Project 1

### Project Title

I created a web application to make it easier for people to find the best restaurants around them.
I used the Python programming language and the Flask framework to build this app. 
This application also uses the location API from Google Maps to display the location of the restaurant.
